# sclust
simple sentence clusterer

A tool to cluster lines of text in a streaming fashion.

E.g., if you have a file like this, with one sentence per line:

```
$ cat /tmp/foo
Hi there, how are you?
hi where how you are
i like to sing
I am going to sing
hi where how you are
hi there how...
do you sing???
```

You can pipe it to `sclust` to get cluster assignments:

```
$ cat /tmp/foo | sclust
0	Hi there, how are you?	-
1	hi where how you are	-
2	i like to sing	-
2	I am going to sing	0.298455
1	hi where how you are	0.336248
0	hi there how...	0.206029
3	do you sing???	-
```
Here, the first column is the cluster assignment and the third column is the cosine similarity between that line and the cluster it is assigned to. The algorithm is online (as opposed to batch), so order matters. At each iteration, a document is assigned to its closest cluster, according to cosine similarity.

Other options:
```
$ sclust --help
A command-line tool to quickly cluster sentences.

usage:
    sclust [--help --threshold <T> --update-norms <N> --prune-frequency <P>]

Options
    -h, --help
    -p, --prune-frequency <P>   Delete small clusters every P lines [default: -1]
    -t, --threshold <N>         Similarity threshold in [0,1]. Higher means sentences must be more similar to be merged. [default: .2]
```

There is also a tool `sclust-summarize` to view the output.

$ sclust-summarize --help
```
A command-line tool to print the top clusters output by sclust in a streaming fashion.
E.g., cat data.txt | sclust | sclust-summarize

usage:
    sclust-summarize [--help --frequency <F> --num-docs-to-print <N> --num-clusters-to-print <K>]

Options
    -h, --help
    -f, --frequency <F>               Print clusters every F lines [default: 1000]
    -n, --num-clusters-to-print <N>   Number of top clusters to print [default: 10]
    -k, --num-docs-to-print <K>       Number of documents per cluster to print [default: 3]
```

E.g.,

```
$ cat /tmp/foo | sclust | sclust-summarize  -k 3

---------7 documents, 4 clusters---------

2	0	Hi there, how are you?	-
 	 	hi there how...	0.206029
2	1	hi where how you are	-
 	 	hi where how you are	0.336248
2	2	i like to sing	-
 	 	I am going to sing	0.298455
1	3	do you sing???	-
```
Here, the first column is cluster frequency, the second column is cluster id. You can optionally print the most recent `k` documents added to the cluster.

The nice thing is you can pipe a large file and see the clusters change as documents are read. E.g., 

```
$  cat /tmp/a_bunch_of_tweets  | sclust -t .2 -u 1000 | sclust-summarize -k 2 -n 5
